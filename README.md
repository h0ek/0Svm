# Hello world

**0Svm** (_0ut3r Space virtual machine_) is a virtual machine for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) based on [Debian Sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/index.html) (_Rolling Release_). This machine is something similar to [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) or [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/), but lightweight, with less tools. There are only tools that I used at least once, and I find them useful, with time there will probably be more and more of them. You can also add your own. I am using it as my machine for learning and bounty programs. Maybe it will be useful to someone else. This project is also related to my website [0ut3r.space](http://0ut3r.space) where I describe various ethical hacking tools and techniques.

This repository contains modified configuration files and scripts used to build and mintaine 0Svm.
