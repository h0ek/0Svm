# Hello world

**0Svm** (_0ut3r Space virtual machine_) is a virtual machine for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) based on [Debian Sid](https://www.debian.org/releases/sid/index.html) (_Rolling Release_). This machine is something similar to [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) or [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/), but lightweight, with less tools. There are only actively developed tools that I used at least once ;) and I find them useful during bounty hunting. Feel free to use it as a base to your bug bounty hunting journey. I am using it as my machine for learning and bounty programs/hacking/testing. Maybe it will be useful to someone else. This project is also related to my website [0ut3r.space](http://0ut3r.space) where I describe various ethical hacking tools and techniques + other security related stuff.

Don't forget to use snapshots. If you break something, you can always return to the original state. Good little machine, for quick testing.

This repository contains modified configuration files and scripts used to build and mintaine **0Svm**.
