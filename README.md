# 0Svm

0Svm (0ut3r Space virtual machine) is a virtual machine for VirtualBox based on Debian Sid (rolling Release). This machine is something similar to Kali Linux or Parrot OS, but lightweight, with less tools. There are only tools that I used at least once, and I find them useful, with time there will probably be more and more of them. You can also add your own. I am using it as my machine for learning and bounty programs. Maybe it will be useful to someone. This project is also related to my website [0ut3r.space](http://0ut3r.space) where I describe various ethical hacking tools and techniques.

Repository contains modified configuration files and scripts used to build and mintaine this machine.
